				<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect your unused or new donated books in exchange for a discount on future purchases as part of our 
                book trade-in scheme.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                These books are used to help children affected by unfortunate circumstances by providing them with schooling
                materials.<br>
                A portion of the money generated through new book sales is used to help provide for everyday school needs, 
                such as meals, stationary and uniforms.<br>
